		<div id="poem-name">O Captain! My Captain!</div>
		<div id="poem-author">By: Walt Whitman</div>
		<div id="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<div class="line">O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,</div>
				<div class="line">The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,</div>
				<div class="line">The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,</div>
				<div class="line">While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;</div>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<div class="line">O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;</div>
				<div class="line">Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,</div>
				<div class="line">For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,</div>
				<div class="line">For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;</div>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<div class="line">My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,</div>
				<div class="line">My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,</div>
				<div class="line">The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,</div>
				<div class="line">From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;</div>
